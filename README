LIONS pipeline architecture
#====================================================================
 LIONS is a bioinformatic analysis pipeline which brings together a
 few pieces of software and some home-brewed scripts to annotate a
 paired-end RNAseq library against a reference TE annotation set
 (such as Repeat Masker).

 East Lion proccesses a bam file input, re-aligns it to a genome,
 builds an ab initio assembly using Tophat2. This assembly is then
 proccessed and local read searches are done at the 5' ends to find
 additional transcript start sites and quality control the 5' ends of
 the assembly. The output is a file-type <library>.lions which
 annotates the intersection between the assembly, a reference gene set
 and repeat set.

 West Lion compiles different .lions files, groups them into biological
 catagories (i.e. Cancer vs. Normal or Treatment vs. Control) and
 compares and analyzes the data to create graphs and meaningful
 interpretation of the data.

# LIONS File Architecture
# ===================================================================
# ./
	base directory:  LIONS is a self-contained pipeline and 
	references needed by LIONS from the system are linked
	within this directory.

	./lions.sh <parameter.ctrl>
		The master script from which the entire pipeline is ran
		The script reads and procceses all files in input.list
		and all parameters can be controlled from parameter.ctrl

	./parameter.ctrl
		A bash script which defines global variables for all LIONS
		scripts. Also defines project-specific variables such as
		Project Name, library input list etc...

	./input.list
		A three column tab-delimited file defining:
		<Library_Name> <Library_Path_on_system> <Biological_Grouping>
		Group Naming Convention: 1 = control 2 = experimental 3 = other
		
	
# ./bin
	Binary: A folder for symbolic links to binaries needed by
	the pipeline and script to initilize the folder.
	
	./bin/initializeBin(_sys).sh
		A bash script which defines the location of all the software
		required by LIONS. Can be set for different systems using the
		_sys suffix and set in the respective paramter.ctrl file.
		Each peice of software will have symbolic links created to link
		it to the correct path in the system.

		The tempalte.lns file is a template for the software
		required.

# ./scripts
	Scripts: all scripts to run lion are held here except for the
	controlling lions.sh script which is in the base folder.
	Check initializeScripts.sh for complete list of scripts

	./scripts/eastLion.sh
